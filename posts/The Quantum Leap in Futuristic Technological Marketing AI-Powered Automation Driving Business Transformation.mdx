AI systems can assist in generating ideas and providing suggestions, but  the spark of inspiration and the ability to connect with customers  on an emotional level remains the exclusive domain of human marketers.


*  **Building Customer Relationships:** AI-powered automation systems can facilitate  personalized customer interactions at  scale, but they  cannot replicate  the human touch. Marketers, with their empathy and emotional intelligence play a crucial role in forging meaningful  relationships with  customers, ensuring that they feel  valued and connected to  the  brand.
